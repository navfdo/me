TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

# Exercise 0

# 4:50pm - Googled how to make strings uppercase and found one answer to be str.upper and my friend told me I could also use a_string.upper()

# 5:00pm - Was having trouble with the shout_with_a_number and realised that it wasn't working because the code was missing a space between the string and the number

# Exercise 1

# 5:10pm - wasn't sure what the "for" loop did so I googled it and learnt that it executes a set of statements, once for each item
